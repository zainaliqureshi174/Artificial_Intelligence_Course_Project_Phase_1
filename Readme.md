This Project was done by Muhammad Zain Ali in Spring 24 in Artificial Intelligence Course.
This project was based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) in Python. In this Project I developed a program which designs a Datae sheat for FAST NUCES Islamabad University Exams.
In this Datesheat I Displayed Room Number, Date, Teacher name (On Duty) and Day name. This Date sheat follows all the constraints given below.

Hard Constraints:
•An exam will be scheduled for each course.
•A student is enrolled in at least 3 courses. A student cannot give more than 1 exam at a time.
•Exam will not be held on weekends.
•Each exam must be held between 9 am and 5 pm.
•Each exam must be invigilated by a teacher. A teacher cannot invigilate two examsat the same time.
•A teacher cannot invigilate two exams in a row.

Soft Constraints:
•All students and teachers shall be given a break on Friday from 1-2.
•A student shall not give more than 1 exam consecutively.
•If a student is enrolled in a MG course and a CS course, it is preferred that their MG course exam be held before their CS course exam.
•Two hours of break in the week such that at least half the faculty is free in one slot and the rest of the faculty is free in the other slot so the faculty meetings shall be
held in parts as they are now.

This GA was applied by in Python and Pandas.
